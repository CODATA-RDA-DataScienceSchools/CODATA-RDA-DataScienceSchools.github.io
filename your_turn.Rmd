Try changing a few things and reknitting a single page or rebuilding the whole site. Do your own thing, or here are a few things to try: 

<br> 

### Add a new page

You'll need to add it to the nav bar in `_site.yml` too.

<br>

### Add a footer

1. move `./advanced/_footer.html` to `./_footer.html` (or create a new one)
2. uncomment the footer in `_site.yml`

<br>

### Add three columns

How would you approach this? See what we did for 3 columns, or Google it.
