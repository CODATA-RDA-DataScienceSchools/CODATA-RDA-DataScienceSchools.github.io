      <description>The School’s Progress 
The first of the schools ran in August 2016 at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy. It was a huge success, delivering the school to 67 students from over 30 countries. The second school, also based at ICTP, in July 2017 was a similar success, with an additional advanced school in the week following it.

      <description>Why the Schools? 
The ever-increasing volume and variety of data being generated impacts academia and the private sector. Contemporary research and evidence-based decision making cannot be done effectively without a range of data-related skills, such as, but not limited to, the principles and practice of Open Science, research data management and curation, data platforms and infrastructures implementation, data analysis, statistics, visualisation and modelling techniques, software development, and annotation. We define ‘Research Data Science’ as the ensemble of these skills.</description>

      <title>Reproducing the School</title>

      <description>We have been putting in place mechanisms to ensure that the schools are as pedagogically effective as possible and that they can be easily reproduced elsewhere. To achieve this, we invite students who attended previous schools to take part as helpers in later schools. Through this approach, such students can become more involved and ultimately be involved in running instances of schools in their region.</description>
