      <description>Venue 
Hosts are required to provide a venue for the School, keeping in mind that a good venue is crucial to establishing a positive learning environment. Some things to consider include:
  Tables arranged so participants can watch the instructor, use their laptops, and talk with their peers. Fold up desks are usually not a good choice.  Tables should be arranged so helpers and instructors can easily mingle around the room.</description>
