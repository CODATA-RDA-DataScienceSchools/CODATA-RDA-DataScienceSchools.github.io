The [CODATA-RDA Research Data Science Summer School](http://www.codata.org/working-groups/research-data-science-summer-schools/datatrieste-2019) provides training in the foundational skills of Research Data Science.  Contemporary research – particularly when addressing the most significant, transdisciplinary research challenges – cannot be done effectively without a range of skills relating to data.  

The school is held at the [International Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ictp.it/). The venue, the Adriatico Guest House, is a delightful self-contained site, overlooking the sea,where there is accommodation, lecture halls, a terminal room and a canteen.  The accommodation and subsistence is heavily subsidised.

**This year the school will be running a parallel strand that is oriented to
students who are interested in Data Stewardship.** 

The curriculum for these students will be 

* Open Science
* Introduction to Unix Shell
* Programming for Analysis
* Git
* Research Data Management
* Author Carpentry
* Introduction to Information Security
* Metadata & Persistent Identifiers
* Data discovery and automated DMP's
* Repositories
* Ontologies
* Linked data

This school is a pilot for a series of CODATA-RDA schools that will run in Europe as part of the [FAIRsFAIR initiative](https://www.fairsfair.eu).

The detailed programme can be found [here](./DataTrieste2019Programme/Timetable.html). 

There is space for 5 students who wish to take the Data Steward strand.
Students wishing to attend this strand will need to cover their accomodation and travel expenses to the school but there are no registration fees.

As this is a pilot students attending this strand will be interviewed afterwards to get feedback to improve the curriculum.

Candidates interested in attending should contact the  director of the Pilot strnd, [Hugh Shanahan](mailto://hugh.shanahan@rhul.ac.uk) before June 1.
