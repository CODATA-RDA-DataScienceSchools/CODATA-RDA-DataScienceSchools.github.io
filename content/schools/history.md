The first of the schools ran in August 2016 at the International Centre for
Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste, Italy.  It was a huge success,
delivering the school to 67 students from over 30 countries.  The second
school, also based at ICTP, in July 2017 was a similar success, with an
additional advanced school in the week following it.

In December 2017, the first regionally run example of the schools was held in
São Paulo, Brazil with 30 students attending from South and Central America.
This represented an important step as roughly half of the material was
delivered by instructors from the region, demonstrating a mechanism for how the
schools will grow in the future.  In 2018 schools ran in Trieste, São Paulo and
Kigali, Rwanda – the first African school.  In 2019 three schools ran in Addis
Ababa, Ethiopia, Trieste and San José, Costa Rica.  In 2020 a school ran in
Pretoria, South Africa and the 5th year of hosting schools will be kicked off
in August with the 5th annual Trieste event.  Trieste 2020 will be the 11th
school and by then approximately 500 students will have completed schools on
five continents.  This corresponds to roughly USD 600k worth of teaching.  It
is remarkable that all of this so far has been achieved using an entirely
volunteer network.
