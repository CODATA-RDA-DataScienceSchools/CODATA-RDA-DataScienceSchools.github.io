title: Reproducing the School

We have been putting in place mechanisms to ensure that the schools are as
pedagogically effective as possible and that they can be easily reproduced
elsewhere.  To achieve this, we invite students who attended previous schools
to take part as helpers in later schools.  Through this approach, such students
can become more involved and ultimately be involved in running instances of
schools in their region.
