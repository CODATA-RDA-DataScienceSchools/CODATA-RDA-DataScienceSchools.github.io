The ever-increasing volume and variety of data being generated impacts academia
and the private sector. Contemporary research and evidence-based decision
making cannot be done effectively without a range of data-related skills, such
as, but not limited to, the principles and practice of Open Science, research
data management and curation, data platforms and infrastructures
implementation, data analysis, statistics, visualisation and modelling
techniques, software development, and annotation. We define ‘Research Data
Science’ as the ensemble of these skills.  

<br />

While the international, collective ability to create, share, and analyse vast
quantities of data is profound, there remains a shortage of individuals skilled
in Research Data Science worldwide, which limits this transformative effect.
With the appropriate data training however, the 'Data Revolution' offers great
opportunities for students and professionals with modern data skills, such as
when entering a job market where these skills are in demand or conducting
research.

<br />

**The CODATA-RDA School for Research Data Science brings these concepts and
tools to communities that may not have been introduced to the wide range of
open resources currently available.**
