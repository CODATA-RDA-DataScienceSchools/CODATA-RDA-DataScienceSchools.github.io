<a id="what-is">{{% title3 "What is the School of Research Data Science?"
%}}</a>

A programme of short courses equipping young researchers globally with core
data skills.

<br />

Our schools provide young researchers with the core skills that will allow them
to be more effective and efficient in the work they do, to analyse the data at
their disposal and to take advantage of the emerging culture of Open Science.

<br />

The primary goal of the Research Data Science School is to teach foundational
Data Science skills to Early Career Researchers in LMICs, with a related goal
of regionalizing training capacity by growing a community of alumni,
instructors, classroom helpers, and hosting institutions. This
train-the-trainer approach and growing community of regional trainers reduces
the cost of the events for the local hosting institutions and increases the
number of events that can be run.

<a id="our-aim">{{% title3 "Our Aim" %}}</a>
Our strategic priority, shared by CODATA and the Research Data Alliance, is to
build capacity and to develop skills, training young researchers in the
principles of Research Data Science.  It is also important that Open Data and
Open Science benefit research in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) and do
not result in even greater inequalities in research and scientific output.  On
the contrary, it has been argued that the ‘Data Revolution’ provides a notable
opportunity for reducing research inequality in a number of respects.  For this
reason, particular attention is paid to the needs of young researchers in
LMICs.

<a id="our-mission">{{% title3 "Our Mission" %}}</a>

* To address a recognised need for Research Data Science Skills
  across disciplines.  
* To use and adapt existing materials to create an accredited curriculum that
  is more than the sum of its parts.
* To provide a pathway from a broad introductory course for all researchers.
* To be reproducible: all materials will be online with Open licences.
* To be scalable: emphasis will be placed on Training New Teachers (TNT) and
  building sustainable partnerships.  
* To pay particular attention to the needs of early career researchers in MICs.
